# DSX Topology Provider

The `dsx` topology provider reads topology data from the **DSX Topology API** and converts it into Topograph's canonical topology graph.

The provider calls `GET /v1/topology/nodes` (or `GET /v1/topology/vpcs/{vpcID}/nodes` for an explicit VPC), which returns an ordered list of switch adjacency entries. Each entry maps a switch name to the set of downstream switches and compute nodes it serves. From this it builds a switch tree (for Slurm `topology/tree` or Kubernetes labels) and, when NVLink domain IDs are present, an accelerator domain map (for `topology/block`).

Authentication and rate limiting are enforced by the Envoy proxy sidecar before requests reach this service. Topograph sends an optional `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header; when no token is configured, the Envoy sidecar is expected to supply SVID-based authentication transparently for in-cluster callers.

## When to Use This Provider

Use this provider for **DSX clusters** where the DSX Topology API is the topology source. It works with both the Slurm engine (generating `topology.conf`) and the Kubernetes engine (labeling nodes).

The request's `nodes` list maps provider node IDs to hostnames. Each VPC's topology is fetched in one paginated sequence of API calls.

## Prerequisites

- The DSX Topology API endpoint reachable from the Topograph host (`base_url`)
- The caller's SVID injected by Envoy (in-cluster, zero-config), **or** a Bearer token with permission to read topology for the VPC

## Credentials

| Field | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `token` | No | Bearer token sent as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. Omit when running in-cluster and relying on the Envoy sidecar for SVID-based authentication |

Store the token in a YAML file when needed:

```yaml
token: <API_TOKEN>
```

Reference that file from the Topograph config:

```yaml
credentialsPath: /etc/topograph/dsx-credentials.yaml
```

Credentials can also be supplied directly in the topology request payload under `provider.creds`.

## Parameters

| Field | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `base_url` | Yes | Base URL for the DSX Topology API, for example `https://topology.example.com` |
| `trimTiers` | No | Number of highest topology tiers to trim from output. Defaults to `0` |

The top-level Topograph `pageSize` setting controls the `page_size` query parameter for paginated topology requests (default 100, max 1000 per the API).

## Configuration

Example Topograph config for Slurm:

```yaml
http:
  port: 49021
  ssl: false

provider: dsx
engine: slurm

requestAggregationDelay: 15s
credentialsPath: /etc/topograph/dsx-credentials.yaml

providerParams:
  base_url: https://topology.example.com

engineParams:
  plugin: topology/tree
  topologyConfigPath: /etc/slurm/topology.conf
```

Example request payload:

```json
{
  "provider": {
    "name": "dsx",
    "creds": {
      "token": "<API_TOKEN>"
    },
    "params": {
      "base_url": "https://topology.example.com"
    }
  },
  "engine": {
    "name": "slurm",
    "params": {
      "plugin": "topology/tree"
    }
  },
  "nodes": [
    {
      "region": "<VPC_OR_REGION>",
      "instances": {
        "<NODE_ID_1>": "node001",
        "<NODE_ID_2>": "node002"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

When running in-cluster without a token, omit the `creds` field entirely — the Envoy sidecar supplies SVID authentication.

## How It Works

The provider collects the node IDs from the request's `nodes` list and sends them as the `node_ids` comma-separated query parameter. It pages through the topology endpoint until the response carries an empty `next_page_token`:

```text
GET <base_url>/v1/topology/nodes?node_ids=<id1>,<id2>&page_size=<pageSize>
Authorization: Bearer <token>          # omitted when using Envoy SVID
```

The response envelope:

```json
{
  "switches": [
    { "<switch-name>": { "switches": ["<child-switch>"], "nodes": [] } },
    { "<leaf-name>":   { "switches": [],                 "nodes": [{ "node_id": "<id>", "accelerated_network_id": "<domain>" }] } }
  ],
  "next_page_token": "<cursor-or-empty>"
}
```

`switches` is an **ordered list of single-key objects**. Non-leaf entries carry `switches` (their downstream switches); leaf entries carry `nodes` (the compute nodes attached to them). This ordering reflects the fabric hierarchy from core to leaf.

Each page's entries are merged into a single topology graph before the next page is requested. When `next_page_token` is empty the loop exits.

Each node is translated as follows:

| API field | Topograph field |
|---|---|
| `node_id` | Instance ID (matched against the request's instance-to-hostname map) |
| Switch that lists the node under its `nodes` | Leaf (tier 0, closest to node) |
| Parent of the leaf (from `switches` adjacency) | Spine (tier 1) |
| Parent of the spine | Core (tier 2) |
| `accelerated_network_id` | Accelerator / NVLink domain (`XclrDomainID`) |

Tier assignment is closest-first: tier 0 is the leaf switch directly attached to the node, tier 1 is the spine, and tier 2 is the core. When `accelerated_network_id` is non-empty the node is placed into that NVLink domain, enabling `topology/block` output.

## Verifying the Output

Sanity-check the API directly (in-cluster, Envoy supplies auth):

```bash
curl -s "$BASE_URL/v1/topology/nodes?node_ids=node1,node2" | jq .
```

Or with an explicit token:

```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  "$BASE_URL/v1/topology/nodes?node_ids=node1,node2" | jq .
```

Then trigger topology generation and read the result:

```bash
id=$(curl -s -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @payload.json http://localhost:49021/v1/generate)
curl -s "http://localhost:49021/v1/topology?uid=$id"
```

For the Slurm engine, verify the generated `topology.conf` reflects the expected switch hierarchy for your nodes.

## Simulation

A `dsx-sim` provider variant is registered for testing without a live API. Instead of calling the topology API, it reads a YAML simulation model and serves it through the same translation path. Select it with `provider: dsx-sim` and point it at a model file via the `modelFileName` parameter; see [Test Mode and Test Provider](./test.md) for the model-file format and simulation parameters.
